## Non-invasive environment query
In the audit report, list the locally available Ollama models (names only).
If you cannot access that list, say “model list unavailable” and continue the audit without installing anything.

If model installation fails, proceed with the default configuration and complete the audit.
Do not attempt to pull models from the internet.
